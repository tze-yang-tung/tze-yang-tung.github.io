Hello, my name is Tze-Yang, I'm a Research Scientist and Entrepreneur. 
My research lies primarily in the junction between machine learning and communications that enable machine learning. 
In particular, I am interested in the emerging **semantic and goal-oriented communications** paradigm and its relations to machine learning applications. 
I believes that a tight integration between machine learning and communications is essential for future AI developments.


## Professional Career

### Member of Technical Staff
**Nokia Bell Labs**

I currently work at Nokia Bell Labs, in the Radio Systems Research Lab. 
My research primarily focuses on applied machine learning in wireless communications and multi-agent systems. 
Specifically, my work focuses on deep learning driven joint source-channel coding and multi-agent collaboration and communications. 
The greatest impact of my research is how these traditional concepts can create the underlying formalism for **semantic and goal-oriented communication**, driving future 6G telecommunications. 


### CEO/Co-founder
[**WAIveform**](https://waiveform.github.io/waiveform-tech/)

I co-founded [WAIveform](https://waiveform.github.io/waiveform-tech/), a startup company that focuses on using machine learning to optimize wireless video transmission. 
Our patented proprietary algorithm simultaneously optimizes video compression and transmission achieving <1ms video latency and no video dropout whatsoever. 


## What I'm good at

### Programming languages

I have over 7 years of experience in **Python** and **C++**, including over **5 years** developing machine learning models using **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow**. 
I also have extensive experience using **GNURadio** with **software defined radios (SDR)**. 
I have also recently started learning **Rust** and found it to be much better for my mental health than C++.

### Hardware

Unlike most machine learning researchers, the models I develop do not simply live in simulation. 
I have extensive experience deploying machine learning models using **C++** and **Docker** on NVIDIA Jetson devices. 

### Entrepreneurship

As a research scientist, I have always been fascinated by the interaction between the commercial world and research and how pressing issues in society can be solved by state-of-the-art research. 
I started my company  to improve the reliability of wireless video streaming for drones and VR devices. 
Throughout the startup experience, I not only worked with people across the industry, including Royal College of Art students to understand their challenges when using VR to create, but also entrepreneurs, such as the CEO of Creator Fund, Jamie Macfarlane, who gave me invaluable advice on how to start a company. 
I also took a course from the Imperial College Business School that taught me the basics of startup entrepreneurship, where I raised the initial funding to start the customer discovery process. 

### System Admin

During my PhD at the [**Information Processing and Communications Lab (IPC-Lab)**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/information-processing-and-communications-lab/), I was the system admin of the group's GPU cluster. 
I was the admin for 3 years, growing the cluster from the initial 8 GPUs to now 30+ GPUs. 
We use a dashboard for monitoring GPU utilization so that everyone in the lab can have access to GPUs, and it is built using **PHP** and **Apache**.
